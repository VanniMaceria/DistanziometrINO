# DistanziometrINO
Ultrasonic Distance Meter - Arduino Project

This Arduino project uses an ultrasonic sensor, an LCD display, and an LED to measure and display distances. The LED lights up when the measured distance is less than 3 cm. The project is ideal for beginners learning to combine sensors, displays, and simple logic in Arduino.

Features:
- Measures distance using an ultrasonic sensor;
- Displays real-time distance values on an LCD;
- Activates an LED when the distance is below 3 cm.

## What you need
Here's a list of the main hardware components required for this Arduino project:

1. **Arduino board** (recommended Arduino UNO or similar):
    - The main control board that processes data from the ultrasonic sensor and controls the LCD and LED.
2. **Ultrasonic sensor** (HC-SR04):
    - Measures the distance between the sensor and an object by emitting ultrasonic waves and calculating the time it takes for the waves to bounce back.
3. **LCD Display** (16x2):
   - Displays the distance measured by the ultrasonic sensor.
4. **Led**:
   - Provides a visual indication when the measured distance is less than 3 cm.

Combine these two circuits, add a led, and you should get something like this:
